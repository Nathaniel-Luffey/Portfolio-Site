Welcome to my Windows 95-inspired React portfolio! This project is designed to replicate the look and feel of the Windows 95 desktop environment while showcasing personal information, projects, and achievements.

Features
1. Windowed Desktop UI: Windows can be opened, minimized, and moved around to mimic a 90s operating system.
2. Desktop Icons: Clickable icons on the desktop open window components featuring various projects.
3. Modular Components: Easily add, remove, or modify “windows” for different portfolio sections.
4. Retro CSS: All CSS assets were built from scratch (except for the icons/logos).
